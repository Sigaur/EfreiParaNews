				Becoming a skydiver is easier than what you might think. First of all you will have to follow theorical classes where you will learn the needed skills to keep you safe. Such skills ranges from handling proprely the canopy, navigate in the air or how to pack your chute.<br>
				After this will come the first jump. First you will jump (alone) with a static line at an approximate altitude of 1200m (4000f). This means that your chute will open automatically.<br>
				After around 5 of thoses jumps you will access the joy of the free fall. First you will try a 10sec freefall, followed by 20sec. You will learn how to be stable in the air.<br>
				Then the real world of skydiving will be accessible to you: a 50-60sec freefall. You will then learn how to do front/back flips while you are falling. Soon you will be jumping with other peoples, performing figures in the sky.
